1) What is the mass of a photon?
A photon has zero mass.

2) What is the size of a quark?
The size of a quark has 2.3 MeV/c2 to 173.07 GeV/c2 approximately.

3) What is the difference between electrical charge and color charge?
Electrical charge is a quality responsible for electrical phenomena in particles, and color charge is responsible for the strong force that acts on quarks and anti-quarks.

4) Explain the difference between a boson and a fermion?
Bosons force camers that the spin is 0,1,2...
Fermions are mutter constitecent that the spin is 1/2, 3/2, 5/2...

5) Describe what type of particle is both a boson and a hadron.  Give and example.
A boson is a subatomic particle, such as a photon.
A hadron is a subatomic particle of a type including the baryons and mesons that can take part in the strong interaction.

6) Explain the purpose of a bubble chamber.
The purpose of a bubble chamber is to detect electrically charged particles moving through it.

7) What are leptons made of?
Leptons are mad of particles that do not experience the nuclear strong force.

8) Name two leptons and two baryons.
Leptons: electrons and positrons
Baryons: protons and nentrons

9) Explain what quantities are conserved at each vertex of a Feynmenn diagram.
Charge, the baryon number and the lepton number are the quantities conserved at the vertices of a Feynman diagram. 

10) Explain what an "exchange particle" is.  Describe its function and provide an example.
An exchange particle is a force carrier particle that produces force when echanged with other force carriers. Gluons are the exchange particles of quarks, generating the strong force and being responsible for the change of their color charge. Gluons are also considered to be the fundamental exchange particle underlying the strong interaction between protons and neutrons in a nucleus.
